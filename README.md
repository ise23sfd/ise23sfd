- 👋 Hi, I’m Louise Lima (@ise23sfd)
- 🌱 I am currently pursuing my PhD in Bioengineering at Stanford (as of September 2023)
    - and just graduated from MIT (June '23) with a Bachelor's in Bioengineering, minors in Computer Science and Neuroscience
- 👀 I’m interested in the start-up biotech space, particularly working with bioinformatics and computational biology to target diseases of aging and the brain.
    - I have 3 years of experience developing CAR-T cell cancer therapy (both academic research and biotech internships).
    - I also have extensive programming experience, primarily in the python, java, MATLAB, and R programming languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on start-up project ideas in the neuroengineering/neurotech space and pursue computational roles in bioinformatics.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at (work) llima23@stanford.edu or (personal) ise23sfd@gmail.com
